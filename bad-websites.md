I hate to throw this website on the bad list...simply because I adore its creator so very much. His name is Arnold World. He spends his time at Powell's bookstore on Burnside making paper flower sculptures that are so realistic it's crazy. But the website for his product is lacking.

This is a very poorly designed website in my opinion. There are too many icons and weird advertisements. The writing is choppy and confusing, and don't even bother navigating through it because you might end up reading about his 90 day plan for successful internet marketing (which he hasn't really achieved himself). I hate to be a hater, but this website made me a little nauseated.

One of my favorite websites because of the Windows 8-style tile design, but so many of the columns are redundant, and there's no rhyme or reason as to why some are to the right and some are down below.

1. **When** you first open the site there’s a pop-up video of a guy introducing the site. The visitor doesn’t get a chance to check out the site first. If you go to a different page on the site and come back to the homepage, he starts up again.

2. How the owner displays recent news is haphazard. The font color changes for each entry making it He uses a different color for each entry so there’s no consistency. Additionally, the site owner puts the whole text for each entry on the main page instead of just having a date and headline with a link to the full entry.  The main paige has entries from 7/23/14 to 2/20/08.

3. There is a warning buoy icon on the right side of the page that stays with you as you scroll down. Pressing it returns you to the top of any page on the site no matter how short it may be. The buoy is intrusive because of its size and bright color. Instead of having links to Hall of Fame, articles, and Bottle Talk laid out at the the top of the page, they’re hidden under “of interest,” while they’re laid out in small, red print at the bottom of the page.

I chose to compare two wine websites for this assignment. I don't like this website mostly because of horrible typography, but it is also very static. It has one image on the page framed by a text box, and seems to be very basic HTML. I don't like anything about this design; I find the text, images, page layout, color scheme, etc. to all be hideous. It doesn't seem like very much thought went into this site.

### [U of O Anthropology](http://pages.uoregon.edu/anthro/)
###### Emmalee

In my work at the U of O, I’m often attempting to navigate through U of O department and program websites for info I need. I have found many of them lacking in design, overstuffed with info and hard to navigate. The U of O Anthropology program website follows these trend.

As we discussed in class, when you arrive at a website you want to have a clear idea of a next step, this website just makes me want to leave because I’m overwhelmed. The moving info on the sidebar is distracting, and the lack of open space make it feel VERY cluttered. The information is NOT categorized in a way that is easy to navigate.

This site does not have the most compelling background or color design. I am not a fan of the typography. It took me about a whole minute to figure out what to click next. I actually skipped trying to figure out how the site works and moved on for a little while. When I finally did figure it out, I liked what came out. The LinkedIn link seemed like it would just take me to her LinkedIn Page so I avoided clicking it. Simplicity was a good thought, but if someone has to click around more to find the basic information from the landing page, I imagine they won't spend that much time on it.
