# These Websites are Bad

http://www.sarverwinery.com
I chose to compare two wine websites for this assignment. I don't like this website mostly because of horrible typography, but it is also very static. It has one image on the page framed by a text box, and seems to be very basic HTML. I don't like anything about this design; I find the text, images, page layout, color scheme, etc. to all be hideous. It doesn't seem like very much thought went into this site. - Courtney

In my work at the U of O, I’m often attempting to navigate through U of O department and program websites for info I need. I have found many of them lacking in design, overstuffed with info and hard to navigate. The U of O Anthropology program website follows these trend.

As we discussed in class, when you arrive at a website you want to have a clear idea of a next step, this website just makes me want to leave because I’m overwhelmed. The moving info on the sidebar is distracting, and the lack of open space make it feel VERY cluttered. The information is NOT categorized in a way that is easy to navigate.

This site does not have the most compelling background or color design. I am not a fan of the typography. It took me about a whole minute to figure out what to click next. I actually skipped trying to figure out how the site works and moved on for a little while. When I finally did figure it out, I liked what came out. The LinkedIn link seemed like it would just take me to her LinkedIn Page so I avoided clicking it. Simplicity was a good thought, but if someone has to click around more to find the basic information from the landing page, I imagine they won't spend that much time on it.
