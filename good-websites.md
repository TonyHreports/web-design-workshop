# These Websites are Good

I like this website a lot! I like how it scrolls up and the image boxes overlap each other. The text box that is being scrolled over also turns off its backlight as you're scrolling past it. The overall design of the website is good, the images are beautiful, and it has a great magazine-style page layout. - Courtney

To find an example of good design, I thought I would look at a local web design company website. http://www.instrument.com/
Their website is enjoyable to interact with, it is simple (i.e lots of open space that makes it easy for your eye to know where to rest) and easy to understand what your next steps should be. Information is given slowly and in clear stages.

This is my friend's site and the first thing you see tells just about everything you would want someone to see off a first impression. His skills and name are listed. There is a video so you see exactly what he looks like and the video is short enough to want to click on. Just about everything you want to see is on the landing page as you scroll down. You don't have to click almost anywhere else to get anymore vital information.

This has much more of a hipster vibe, but I appreciate its simplicity. Clear hyperlinks to all the vital information. Great color design and it gives a clear message. Enough to want to find out a little more.
